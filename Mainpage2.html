        I'm trying not to, kid. I call it luck. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Don't underestimate the Force. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?
        
        Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Don't underestimate the Force. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I don't know what you're talking about.
        
        Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
        
        Red Five standing by. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? What!? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
        
        Red Five standing by.
        Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?
        Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.
        Red Five standing by.
        
        Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I'm trying not to, kid.
        
        Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
        Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.
        As you wish.
        Ye-ha! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
        
        I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.
        
        The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. As you wish. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!
        
        Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.
        
        Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
        
        Ye-ha! What?! The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?
        
        Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
        
        A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.
        
        Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?

        Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't underestimate the Force. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.
        
        You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I'm trying not to, kid.
